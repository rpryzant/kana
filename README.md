This was a little project which I ended up dropping, but I had some results suggesting the idea worked.

People sometimes initialize vocabs using word vectors in small-to-medium-data Japanese-English NMT. We want to show that initializing Kanji radicals with the english word vector for their reading can beat equivalent vectors learned from Japanese data.

results/etc are on jagupard10 & 11
